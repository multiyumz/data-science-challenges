# ⛰ "Train At Scale" Unit 🗻

In this unit, you will learn how to package the notebook provided by the Data Science team at WagonCab, and how to scale it so that it can be trained locally on the full dataset.

This unit consists of the 5 challenges below, they are all grouped up in this single `README` file.

Simply follow the guide and `git push` after each main section so we can track your progress!

# 1️⃣ Local Setup

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>❓Instructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

As lead ML Engineer for the project, your first role is to set up a local working environment (with `pyenv`) and a python package that only contains the skeleton of your code base.

💡 Packaging notebooks is a key ML Engineer skill. It allows
- other users to collaborate on the code
- you to clone the code locally or on a remote machine to, for example, train the `taxifare` model on a more powerful machine
- you to put the code in production (on a server that never stops running) to expose it as an **API** or through a **website**
- you to render the code operable so that it can be run manually or plugged into an automation workflow

### 1.1) Create a new pyenv called [🐍 taxifare-env]

🐍 Create the virtual env

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{local_path_to("07-ML-Ops/01-Train-at-scale/01-Train-at-scale")}}
python --version # First, check your Python version for <YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION> below (e.g. 3.10.6)
```

```bash
pyenv virtualenv <YOUR_PYTHON_VERSION> taxifare-env
pip install --upgrade pip
pyenv local taxifare-env
code .
```

Then, make sure both your OS' Terminal and your VS Code's integrated Terminal display `[🐍 taxifare-env]`.
In VS code, open any `.py` file and check that `taxifare-env` is activated by clicking on the pyenv section in the bottom right, as seen below:

    <img src='https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/07-ML-OPS/pyenv-setup.png' width=400>
</a>

### 1.2) Get familiar with the taxifare package structure

❗️Take 10 minutes to understand the structure of the boilerplate we've prepared for you (don't go into detail); its entry point is `taxifare.interface.main_local`

```bash
. # Challenge folder root
├── Makefile          # Main "interface" with your project; use it to launch tests, start trainings, etc. from the CLI
├── README.md         # The file you are reading right now!
├── notebooks
│   └── datascientist_deliverable.ipynb   # The deliverable from the DS team!
├── pytest.ini         # Test configuration file (please do not touch)
├── requirements.txt   # List all third-party packages to add to your local environment
├── setup.py           # Enable `pip install` for your package
├── taxifare           # The code logic for this package
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── interface
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── main_local.py  # Your main Python entry point that contains all the "routes" that will be accessible from outside (a.k.a. the web!)
│   └── ml_logic
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── data.py           # Save, load and clean data
│       ├── encoders.py       # Custom encoder utilities
│       ├── model.py          # TensorFlow model
│       ├── params.py         # Global project params
│       ├── preprocessor.py   # Sklearn preprocessing pipelines
│       ├── registry.py       # Save and load models
│       └── utils.py          # Useful Python functions that can be shared across the taxifare package
├── tests  # Tests to run using `make pytest`
│   ├── ...
│   └── ...
├── .gitignore
```

🐍 Install your package on this new virtual env

```bash
cd ~/code/<user.github_nickname>/{{local_path_to("07-ML-Ops/01-Train-at-scale/01-Train-at-scale")}}
pip install -e .
```

Make sure the package is installed by running `pip list | grep taxifare`; it should print the absolute path to the package.


### 1.3) Let's store all our data locally in `~/.lewagon/mlops/`

💾 Let's store our `data` folder *outside* of this challenge folder so that it can be accessed by all other challenges throughout the whole ML Ops module. We don't want it to be tracked by `git` anyway!

``` bash
# Create the data folder
mkdir -p ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/

# Create relevant subfolders
mkdir ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw
mkdir ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/processed
```

💡While we are here, let's also create a storage folder for our `training_outputs` that will also be shared by all challenges

```bash
# Create the training_outputs folder
mkdir ~/.lewagon/mlops/training_outputs

# Create relevant subfolders
mkdir ~/.lewagon/mlops/training_outputs/metrics
mkdir ~/.lewagon/mlops/training_outputs/models
mkdir ~/.lewagon/mlops/training_outputs/params
```

You can now see that the data for the challenges to come is stored in `~/.lewagon/mlops/`, along with the notebooks of the Data Science team and the model outputs:

``` bash
tree -a ~/.lewagon/mlops/

# YOU SHOULD SEE THIS
├── data          # This is where you will:
│   ├── processed # Store intermediate, processed data
│   └── raw       # Download samples of the raw data
└── training_outputs
    ├── metrics # Store trained model metrics
    ├── models  # Store trained model weights (can be large!)
    └── params  # Store trained model hyperparameters
```

🌐 Now, download the raw datasets

```bash
# 4 training sets
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/train_1k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/train_1k.csv
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/train_10k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/train_10k.csv
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/train_100k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/train_100k.csv
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/train_500k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/train_500k.csv

# 4 validation sets
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/val_1k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/val_1k.csv
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/val_10k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/val_10k.csv
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/val_100k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/val_100k.csv
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/val_500k.csv > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/val_500k.csv
```

❗️And only if you have an **excellent** internet connection (with 100Mbps it should take about 2min) and 6GBs of free storage on your computer; **not** mandatory

```bash
curl https://storage.googleapis.com/datascience-mlops/taxi-fare-ny/train_50M.csv.zip > ~/.lewagon/mlops/data/raw/train_50M.csv.zip
```

# 2️⃣ Understand the Work of a Data Scientist

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>❓Instructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

*⏱ Duration:  spend 1 hour at most on this*

🖥️ Open `datascientist_deliverable.ipynb` with VS Code (forget about Jupyter for this module), and run all cells carefully, while understanding them. This handover between you and the DS team is the perfect time to interact with them (i.e. your buddy or a TA).

❗️Make sure to use `taxifare-env` as an `ipykernel` venv

# 3️⃣ Package Your Code

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>❓Instructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

🎯 Your goal is to be able to run the `taxifare.interface.main_local` module as seen below

```bash
# -> model
python -m taxifare.interface.main_local
```

🖥️ To do so, please code the missing parts marked with `# YOUR CODE HERE` in the following files; it should follow the Notebook pretty closely!

```bash
├── taxifare
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── interface
│   │   ├── __init__.py
│   │   └── main_local.py   # 🔵💡 Start here: code both `preprocess_and_train` and `pred`
│   └── ml_logic
│       ├── __init__.py
│       ├── data.py          # 🔵 `clean data`
│       ├── encoders.py      # 🔵 `transform_time_features`, `transform_lonlat_features`, `compute_geohash`
│       ├── model.py         # 🔵 `initialize_model`, `compile_model`, `train_model`
│       ├── params.py        # 💡  You can change `DATASET_SIZE`
│       ├── preprocessor.py  # 🔵 `preprocess_features`
│       ├── registry.py  # ✅ `save_model` and `load_model` are already coded for you
│       └── utils.py     # ✅ keep for later
```

**🧪 Test your code**

❗️First, make sure your package runs properly with `python -m taxifare.interface.main_local`.
- Debug it until it runs!
- Use the following dataset sizes

```python
# taxifare/ml_logic/params.py
DATASET_SIZE = '1k'   # To iterate faster in debug mode 🐞
DATASET_SIZE = '100k' # Should work at least once
```

❗️Then, only try to pass tests with `make test_train_at_scale_3`!


</details>

# 4️⃣ Investigate Scalability

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>❓Instructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

*⏱ Duration:  spend 20 minutes at most on this*

Now that you've managed to make the package work for a small dataset, time to see how it will handle the real dataset!

👉 Change `ml_logic.params.DATASET_SIZE` and `ml_logic.params.VALIDATION_DATASET_SIZE` to `'500k'` to start getting serious!

🕵️ Investigate which part of your code takes **the most time** and uses **the most memory**, and try to answer the following questions with your buddy:
- What part of your code holds the key bottlenecks?
- What kinds of bottlenecks are the most worrying? (time, memory, etc.)
- Do you think it will scale to 50M rows?
- Can you think about potential solutions? Write down your ideas, but do not implement them yet!

💡 **Hint:** Use `ml_logic.utils.simple_time_and_memory_tracker` to decorate the methods of your choice as seen below

```python
# taxifare.ml_logic.data.py
from taxifare.ml_logic.utils import simple_time_and_memory_tracker

@simple_time_and_memory_tracker
def clean_data() -> pd.DataFrame:
    ...
```

**Optional:** if you don't remember exactly how decorators work, refer to our [04/05-Communicate](https://kitt.lewagon.com/camps/<user.batch_slug>/lectures/content/04-Decision-Science_05-Communicate.slides.html?title=Communicate#/6/3) lecture!

# 5️⃣ Incremental Processing

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>❓Instructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

🎯 Your goal is to improve your codebase to be able to train the model on **50M+ rows**, **without** RAM limits.

### 5.1) Discussion

**What did we learn?**

In the previous challenge we saw that we have memory and time constraints:
- The `(55M, 8)`-shaped `raw_data` gets loaded into memory as a DataFrame and takes up about 12GB of RAM, which is too much for most computers
- The `(55M, 65)`-shaped preprocessed DataFrame is even bigger
- The `ml_logic.encoders.compute_geohash` method takes a long time to process 🤯

**What could we do?**

1. One solution is to pay for a **cloud Virtual Machine (VM)** with enough RAM and process it there (this is often the simplest way to deal with such a problem)
2. Another could be to load each column of the `raw_data` individually and perform some preprocessing on it, **column by column**

```python
for col in column_names:
    df_col = pd.read_csv("raw_data.csv", usecols=col)
    # Preprocess a single column here
```

You may encounter datasets, however, whose individual columns are too big to load anyway! By the way, the [real NYC dataset](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page) is even bigger than 55M rows and weighs in at about 156GB!

**Proposed solution**: incremental preprocessing, 🔪 chunk by chunk 🔪

Did you notice that our preprocessing is **stateless**?
- We don't need to store (_fit_) any information about columns of the train set, such as _standard deviation_, to apply it (_transform_) on the test set.
- We can therefore decouple the _preprocessing_ from the _training_ instead of grouping everything into a `preprocess_and_train` pipeline.
  - We will `preprocess` and store `data_processed` on our hard drive for good, then we will `train` our model on `data_processed` later on.
  - When new data arrives, we'll simply apply the preprocessing to it as a pure python function.

Secondly, as we do not need to compute _column-wise statistics_ but only perform _row-by-row preprocessing_, we can do the preprocessing **chunk by chunk**, with chunks of limited size (e.g. 100.000 rows), each chunk fitting nicely in memory! And then simply append each _preprocessed chunk_ to the end of a CSV on our local disk. It won't make it faster but at least it will compute without crashing, and you only need to do it once.

### 5.2) Your turn

👶 **First, let's bring back smaller dataset sizes for debugging purposes**

```python
# params.py
DATASET_SIZE = '1k'
VALIDATION_DATASET_SIZE = '1k'
CHUNK_SIZE = 200
```

**Then, code the new route given below by `def preprocess()` in your `ml_logic.interface.main_local` module; copy and paste the code below to get started**

[//]: # (  🚨 Code below is NOT the single source of truth. Original is in data-solutions repo 🚨 )

<br>

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'>👇 Code to copy 👇</summary>

```python
def preprocess(source_type='train'):
    """
    Preprocess the dataset iteratively by loading data in chunks that fit in memory,
    processing each chunk, appending each of them to a final dataset, and saving
    the final preprocessed dataset as a CSV file
    """

    print("\n⭐️ Use case: preprocess")

    # Local saving paths given to you (do not overwrite these data_path variables)
    source_name = f"{source_type}_{DATASET_SIZE}.csv"
    destination_name = f"{source_type}_processed_{DATASET_SIZE}.csv"

    data_raw_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(LOCAL_DATA_PATH, "raw", source_name))
    data_processed_path = os.path.abspath(os.path.join(LOCAL_DATA_PATH, "processed", destination_name))

    # Iterate over the dataset, in chunks
    chunk_id = 0

    # Let's loop until we reach the end of the dataset, then `break` out
    while (True):
        print(f"processing chunk n°{chunk_id}...")

        try:
            # Load the chunk numbered `chunk_id` of size `CHUNK_SIZE` into memory
            # 🎯 Hint: check out pd.read_csv(skiprows=..., nrows=..., headers=...)
            # We advise you to always load data with `header=None`, and add back column names using COLUMN_NAMES_RAW
            # 👉 YOUR CODE HERE

        except pd.errors.EmptyDataError:
            # 🎯 Hint: what would you do when you reach the end of the CSV?
            # 👉 YOUR CODE HERE


        # Clean chunk; pay attention, sometimes it can result in 0 rows remaining!
        # 👉 YOUR CODE HERE

        # Create X_chunk, y_chunk
        # 👉 YOUR CODE HERE

        # Create X_processed_chunk and concatenate (X_processed_chunk, y_chunk) into data_processed_chunk
        # 👉 YOUR CODE HERE

        # Save and append the chunk of the preprocessed dataset to a local CSV file
        # Keep headers on the first chunk: for convention, we'll always save CSVs with headers in this challenge
        # 🎯 Hints: check out pd.to_csv(mode=...)

        # 👉 YOUR CODE HERE

        chunk_id += 1

    # 🧪 Write outputs so that they can be tested by make test_train_at_scale (do not remove)
    data_processed = pd.read_csv(data_processed_path, header=None, skiprows=1, dtype=DTYPES_PROCESSED_OPTIMIZED).to_numpy()
    write_result(name="test_preprocess", subdir="train_at_scale", data_processed_head=data_processed[0:10])


    print("✅ data processed saved entirely")

```

</details>

<br>

**❓Try to create and store the following preprocessed datasets**

- `data/processed/train_processed_1k.csv` by running `preprocess()`
- `data/processed/val_processed_1k.csv` by running `preprocess(source_type='val')`

<br>

**🧪 Test your code**

Test your code with `make test_train_at_scale_5`.

<br>

**❓Finally, create and store the real preprocessed datasets**

Using:
```python
# params.py
DATASET_SIZE = '500k'
VALIDATION_DATASET_SIZE = '500k'
CHUNK_SIZE = 100000
```
To create:
- `data/processed/train_processed_500k.csv` by running `preprocess()`
- `data/processed/val_processed_500k.csv` by running `preprocess(source_type='val')`

🎉 Given a few hours of computation, we could easily process the 55 Million rows too, but let's not do it today!

# 6️⃣ Incremental Learning

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>❓Instructions (expand me)</strong></summary>

<br>

🎯 Goal: train our model on the full `data_processed.csv`

### 6.1) Discussion

We cannot load such a big dataset of shape `(55M, 65)` into RAM all at once, but we can load it in chunks.

**How do we train a model in chunks?**

This is called **incremental learning**, or **partial_fit**
- We initialize a model with random weights ${\theta_0}$
- We load the first `data_processed_chunk` into memory (say, 100_000 rows)
- We train our model on the first chunk and update its weights accordingly ${\theta_0} \rightarrow {\theta_1}$
- We load the second `data_processed_chunk` into memory
- We *retrain* our model on the second chunk, this time updating the previously computed weights ${\theta_1} \rightarrow {\theta_2}$!
- We rinse and repeat until the end of the dataset

❗️Not all Machine Learning models support incremental learning; only *parametric* models $f_{\theta}$ that are based on *iterative update methods* like Gradient Descent support it
- In **scikit-learn**, `model.partial_fit()` is only available for the SGDRegressor/Classifier and a few others ([read this carefully 📚](https://scikit-learn.org/0.15/modules/scaling_strategies.html#incremental-learning)).
- In **TensorFlow** and other Deep Learning frameworks, training is always iterative, and incremental learning is the default behavior! You just need to avoid calling `model.initialize()` between two chunks!

❗️Do not confuse `chunk_size` with `batch_size` from Deep Learning

👉 For each (big) chunk, your model will read data in many (small) batches over several epochs

<img src='https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/data-science-images/07-ML-OPS/train_by_chunk.png'>

👍 **Pros:** this universal approach is framework-independent; you can use it with `scikit-learn`, XGBoost, TensorFlow, etc.

👎 **Cons:** the model will be biased towards fitting the *latest* chunk better than the *first* ones. In our case, it is not a problem as our training dataset is shuffled, but it is important to keep that in mind when we do a partial fit of our model with newer data once it is in production.

<br>

<details>
  <summary markdown='span'><strong>🤔 Do we really need chunks with TensorFlow?</strong></summary>

Granted, thanks to TensorFlow datasets you will not always need "chunks" as you can use batch-by-batch dataset loading as seen below

```python
import tensorflow as tf

ds = tf.data.experimental.make_csv_dataset(data_processed_55M.csv, batch_size=256)
model.fit(ds)
```

Still, in this challenge, we would like to teach you the universal method of incrementally fitting in chunks, as it applies to any framework, and will prove useful to *partially retrain* your model with newer data once it is put in production.

### 6.2) Your turn

**Try to code the new route given below by `def train()` in your `ml_logic.interface.main_local` module; copy and paste the code below to get started**

Again, start with a very small dataset size, then finally train your model on 500k rows.

    print("✅ model trained and saved")
```

You should get an MAE below 3 on the validation set!
