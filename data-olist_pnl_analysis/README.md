## Seller P&L Analysis + GeoPandas

### Part 1: 💵

The goal of this exercise is to compute, for each `seller_id`:

- The **revenue** it brings (10% of each sales + 80 BRL per month)
- The **cost** associated with all its bad reviews (1-star = 100 BRL, 2-star = 50, 3-star=40)
- The associated **profit** for Olist

### Part 2: 🌎

Once that's done, there's an optional section that will introduce you to the wonderful world of GeoPandas!
```bash
jupyter notebook seller_pnl_recap.ipynb
```
